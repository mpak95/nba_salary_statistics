# NBA Salary Statistics

This repository will demonstrate the ability to automatically pull in NBA Team Salary data using the py_ball library, calculate the breakdown of each players salary in relation to the total team salary, and store that data in a PostgreSQL database.

The workflow management will be handled by Apache Airflow, and the data will be stored using a PostgreSQL database. Both applications will be stored in its own Docker Container.
